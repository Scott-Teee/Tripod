Two Constitutions:
Which one(s) are in use?

      By Brian Murphy

In the Act for Admission of
California into the Union (Vol. 9,
Statutes at Large page 452) notice
that February 13, 1850 is when the
President delivered a Constitution
to Congress written by the people
of California, but the Title page
of the California Constitution is
dated 1879. Notice that Congress
examined the Constitution and
found it to be Republican in its
form of government. What is the
difference between a Democracy
and a Republic as in
"CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC,"
which is on our bear flag? By the
way, speaking of the bear flag,
why did the legislature designate
a flag as the State flag in 1911,
61 years after the flag's creation?
I don't hear the average citizen
talk about the Two Constitutions.
It puzzles me so much, I ask
people what they know about it.
What is the reason there are Two
Constitutions? Maybe there is
only one Constitution, but the
1879 is an updated version. Look
at Article III Sec. 2. "The
boundaries of the state are those
stated in the Constitution of 1849
as modified pursuant to statute.
Sacramento is the capitol of
California." If the 1879 is the
Constitution we now use, then
why didn't it just spell out what
the boundaries were? Doesn't it
seem logical that if the new one
refers to the old one, that they
would keep a copy of the old one
on file so that the Citizens could
examine it? When I ask. "if. . .
they would keep," I am referring
to the government. I have a couple
of copies of the 1849 Constitution

myself, but I would like to
compare the handwriting and the
signatures with the government
copy. Also, I would like to know
what the police officers and judges
have sworn to uphold this
constitution. I have searched
vigorously, and have been unable
to find a copy of the 1849
Constitution law libraries, or at
the Capitol in Sacramento.
Let's examine the very first page
of the 1879 California
Constitution. I see that the Title
has as asterisk which refers to a
footnote. "For effective date, see
Art. XXII, Sec. 12.," the footnote
says. Well, Article XXII bas been
repealed, so I don't know where
to look, to read it!
Now, I told you about my copy
of the 1849 Constitution, so I
would like to quote an important
and interesting section:
Article IV, Legislative
Department
Sec. 1. The legislative power of
this state shall be vested in a
senate and assembly, which shall
be vested in a senate and assembly,
which shall be designated as the
Legislature of the state of
California; and the enacting
clause of every law shall be as
follows: "The people of the state
of California, represented in
Senate and Assembly, do enact as
follows."
Now, look at the one of the
California "codes," first page like
the DMV code. Why don't they
use the same phrase anymore?
I have a research paper quoting
II Cal Jur 2d Constitutional Law
which say the 1879 is a
"substitute" for the 1849 one. I

went research that but the Third
edition at the Law Library didn't
have the same language. It does
say at Section 16 "The people, in
adopting the constitution of 1879,
did not intend to disturb in any way
the order of things existing in the
state by the alterations and
amendment of their organic law.
... " Later, the Third Edition does
mention the word "substitute"
when it says that other courts were
created and substituted for the
former. (With substitute judges I
imagine.)
I am writing this article because
I am interested in learning more
about the creation of our state. I
am proud to live in a state that like
Texas, fought for its independence
and entered the Union as a country
on its own right and upon the will
of the people. Equally as
important, I want others to know
the facts. Who created what and
controls who?
My interpretation of 13 Cal Jur
3rd, sec. 4 is: When the 1849
Constitution was written it was
thought that a Constitution secured
absolute and inalienable rights to
the citizens and these rights were
in fact limitations on the
governmental powers and the
operation of the Constitution was
operated directly on the
government only. (They are the
ones taking the oaths). The theory
has changed according to Sec. 4.
Why did the theory change? I
believe it is my duty to loudly say:
We, as Citizens of California
Republic, remembering what we
fought for are now claiming our
inalienable rights and they will be
secured!
